One at a time, features were slowly developed such as mechanisms to steer, a way to propel the bicycle forward without touching the ground, and system to slow and stop the bike. In the timeline below, we highlight both major milestones for the bicycle as well as smaller innovations that show the evolution leading up to the modern bicycle:</p>
