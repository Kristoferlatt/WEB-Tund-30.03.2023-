               <h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
           <p>
           The bicycle has a history that goes back about 600 years and is
           quite different than the bike as we know today. Many major innovations
           have dramatically transformed the bicycle’s form and features over the years.
           Earlier models had two wheels, but no way to steer, and even required a running start.
           One at a time, features were slowly developed such as mechanisms to steer, a way to propel
           the bicycle forward without touching the ground, and system to slow and stop the bike.
           In the timeline below, we highlight both major milestones for the bicycle as well as smaller
           innovations that show the evolution leading up to the modern bicycle:
